How to use Bangla Typing
=====================
To type Bangla, simply type the english characters that are closest to their bangla counterparts. Hitting a key multiple times will cycle through all similar sounds. 

Typing conjunct characters is as easy as knowing the constitutive characters! Simply type a character, and then type a virama, and then another character. This can be repeated indefinitely, except that unicode has inherent limits to constructing the conjuncts on screen. In that case, you will see characters with the virama under them, followed by the rest of the conjunct. The virama and all special characters are grouped under the "m" key.
