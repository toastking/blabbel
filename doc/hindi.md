How to use Hindi Typing
=====================
Typing Hindi is no sweat. For the characters in Hindi, you can simply tap the key the similar phonetic value. Similar sounds are grouped under the same key. Pressing the key multiple times switches the character to the next. Once all are iterated over, it moves on to the next letter to type. 

Typing conjunct characters is as easy as knowing the constitutive characters! Simply type a character, and then type a virama, and then another character. This can be repeated indefinitely, except that unicode has inherent limits to constructing the conjuncts on screen. In that case, you will see characters with the virama under them, followed by the rest of the conjunct. The virama and all special characters are grouped under the "m" key.
